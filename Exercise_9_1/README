QUESTION
========

Write a program that uses the F( ) macro shown at the beginning of the chapter and demonstrates 
that it does not expand properly, as described in the text. Repair the macro and show that it works correctly.

APPROACH
========

The file main.cpp contains two macros, namely F and G.
F is the  macro that doesn't expand properly and G is the fixed version of F (i.e. expands in the way we
want it to expand).

In order to make this code compilable the 'call' to F is commented out. A further block comment in main.cpp describes
the problem in more detail.

OBSERVATIONS
============

Except of header guards I never used macros before and therefore this question was a bit new to me. I found out
that 'cpp' the preprocessor can be very helpful to visualise the result of the preprocessor output.

One can uncomment the marcro call to F(1) and then execute 'cpp main.cpp' and see why the preprocessed main.cpp file
is not compileable.

Also it is quite shocking that a simple cpp program which consist of just a handful of lines of code expands to more than 17k lines of
preprocessed code (which comes from the <iostream> include, but still ...).
