QUESTION
========

7.1 Create a Text class that contains a string object to hold the text of a file. Give it two constructors: a 
default constructor and a constructor that takes a string argument that is the name of the file to open. When 
the second constructor is used, open the file and read the contents into the string member object. Add a member 
function contents( ) to return the string so (for example) it can be printed. In main( ), open a file using Text 
and print the contents.

APPROACH
========

The file main.cpp contains the code to that questions. Please proceed with:
$ make
$ ./bin
