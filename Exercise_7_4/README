QUESTION
========

Create a class that contains four member functions, with 0, 1, 2, and 3 int arguments, respectively. Create a main( ) 
that makes an object of your class and calls each of the member functions. Now modify the class so it has instead a single 
member function with all the arguments defaulted. Does this change your main( )?

APPROACH
========

The file main.cpp contains two implementation of the same class 'Calculator' which defines a add() function. 

Version I uses function overloading and
Version II uses default arguemtents to fulfill the requiremnts mentioned in the question 7.4.

OBSERVATIONS
============

The code inside main() does not need to be changed no matter which version (I or II) is used.
