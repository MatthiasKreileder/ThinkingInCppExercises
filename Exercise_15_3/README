OBSERVATIONS
============

Subquestion 15.3.1 - create a function that takes a Shape object by value and try to upcast a derived object in as an argument
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This function doen't compile because it tries to create an object of an abstract class.

Subquestion 15.3.2 - Fix the function by taking a reference to the Shape object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This compiles without problems.
