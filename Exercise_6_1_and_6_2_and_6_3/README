QUESTION
========

6.1 Write a simple class called Simple with a constructor that prints something to tell you that it’s been called. 
In main( ) make an object of your class.
6.2 Add a destructor to Exercise 1 that prints out a message to tell you that it’s been called.
6.3 Modify Exercise 2 so that the class contains an int member. Modify the constructor so that it takes an int argument 
that it stores in the class member. Both the constructor and destructor should print out the int value as part of their message, 
so you can see the objects as they are created and destroyed.

ANSWER
======

I think the code in main.cpp does not need to be commented, so I save both of us the noise here. Please proceed with

$ make
$ ./bin

OBSERVATION
===========

One thing is actually worth to be mentioned: Since all three objects are created on the stack we can see that the destructors are called in the reverse order in which the constructors are
called which makes sense (they are living on the stack) but it's nice to see it and point it out.
