QUESTION
========

Create a three-level hierarchy of classes with default constructors, along with destructors, both of
which announce themselves to cout. Verify that for an object of the most derived type, all three
constructors and destructors are automatically called. Explain the order in which the calls are
made.

ANSWER
======

Approach and Observations
-------------------------
I created a source file main.cpp which defines a three level class hierachy Top, Middle, Bottom where Top is the base class and Bottom is the most derived class.
In main.cpp I create an object of type Botton on the stack.

Executing

$ make && ./bin

will show the order of ctor and dtor calls.
The constructors calls starts with the base class and end with the most derived type (probably for several reasons but the most obvious one
is that a derived class constructor may want to use base class functionality or members it has access to).

The destructors calls start with the most derived class and end with the base class.
