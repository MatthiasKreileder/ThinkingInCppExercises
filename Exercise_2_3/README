Question
========

Question 2.3 states: Create a program that opens a file and counts the whitespace-separated words in that file.

Algorithm
=========

I implemented an algorithm that counts the words in a provided ASCII file. 

Since it is not defined what is meant by the term "word" I came up with my own rules.

(1) A word consists of one or more alphabetical characters (i.e. a,b,c,...,z as well as A,B,C,...Z)
(2) Stand-alone non-alphabetical characters (i.e. '#','?' or '!') or groups of them (e.g. '#!?') are not words


Some examples might help to clarify

"Hello World" = 2 words
"Hello, World" = 2 words
"Hello !" = 1 word
"#,!A!,#" = 1 word

The last example might be seen as odd, but since 'A' is a valid English word I count this as one word as well.

Build
=====

To build the source code execute make in the top level directory (i.e. the one that contains the makefile :).
A binary named word_counter should be created.

Run
===

You need to provide the binary an ASCII text file (I assume your file is called 'yourFile.txt') and invoke the program like this:
$ echo "My name is Matt" >> fileName.txt 
$ ./word_counter yourFile.txt
fileName.txt contains 4 words

Test
====

If you want to build and run the tests then please first open the makefile and set the two variables BOOST_INCLUDE and BOOST_LIB to the path where you have installed
boost on your system (I used Boost 1.60.0).

Then type

$ make check

and that should run the unit tests.
