Question 2.3 states: Create a program that opens a file and counts the whitespace-separated words in that file.

I implemented an algorithm that counts the words in a provided ASCII file. 

Since it is not defined what is meant by the term "word" I came up with my own rules.

(1) A word consists of one or more alphabetical characters (i.e. a,b,c,...,z as well as A,B,C,...Z)
(2) Stand-alone non-alphabetical characters (i.e. '#','?' or '!') or groups of them (e.g. '#!?') are not words


Some examples might help to clarify

"Hello World" = 2 words
"Hello, World" = 2 words
"Hello !" = 1 word
"#,!A!,#" = 1 word

The last example might be seen as odd, but since 'A' is a valid English word I count this as one word as well.
