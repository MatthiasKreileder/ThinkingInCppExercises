QUESTION
========

Create a simple class with an overloaded operator++. Try calling this operator in both 
pre- and postfix form and see what kind of compiler warning you get.

APPROACH
========

I developed a simple class called 'Integer' which provides two overloads for post and prefix increment.
In the main function I create an object on type 'Integer' and invoke both operators

OBSERVATIONS
============

Even with the -Wall flag g++ didn't criticize my code... If there is a lesson's learned that I missed here I would
be happy about feedback.
