QUESTION
========

11.3
Write a program in which you try to (1) Create a reference that is not initialized when it is created. 
(2) Change a reference to refer to another object after it is initialized. (3) Create a NULL reference.

11.4
Write a function that takes a pointer argument, modifies what the pointer points to, and then returns the destination 
of the pointer as a reference

11.8
Create a function that takes a char& argument and modifies that argument. In main( ), print out a char variable, call your 
function for that variable, and print it out again to prove to yourself that it has been changed. How does this affect program readability?

APPROACH
========

I inserted comments into main.cpp which I think are sufficient.

OBSERVATIONS
============

I was a bit puzzled about how to achieve 11.3 subquestion (2) 'Change a reference to refer to another object after it is initialized'. Is there a syntax which
allows you to express that in code?!
