Question
========

Create two classes called Traveler and Pager without default constructors, but with constructors
that take an argument of type string, which they simply copy to an internal string variable. For
each class, write the correct copy-constructor and assignment operator. Now inherit a class
BusinessTraveler from Traveler and give it a member object of type Pager. Write the correct
default constructor, a constructor that takes a string argument, a copy-constructor, and an
assignment operator.

Approach
========

I created all classes as stated in the question description.

The file main.cpp creates two objects of type BusinessTraveler, namely "first" and "second".
Then the assigment operator is used to copy the data from "first" to "second".
Then both objects are streamed to std::cout.

Please execute 
$ make && ./bin

to run main(). The output format is described below.

Output format
-------------

You should see two lines where each line has the same structure:
"contents of the object named <object_name>:" Traveler_string=<content of the string stored in Traveler> Pager_string=<content of the string stored in Pager>
